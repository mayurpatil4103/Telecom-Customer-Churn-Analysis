🧪 Tools & Technologies Used
Google Colab – For interactive notebook and data processing
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling and transformation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Dataset – Customer Churn.csv (7043 entries, 21 columns)

📊 Key Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Contract Type (highest churn in month-to-month)
Payment Method (electronic check users churn more)
Tenure (early-stage users churn more)
Senior Citizens, Internet Services, and Value-Added Services.
