### **🧪 Tools & Technologies Used**

- Google Colab – For interactive notebook and data processing,
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy – Data handling and transformation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
- Dataset – Customer Churn.csv (7043 entries, 21 columns)

---

### **📊 Key Analysis Performed:**

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Converted TotalCharges to numeric Replaced missing values and fixed data types
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Contract Type (highest churn in month-to-month),
- Payment Method (electronic check users churn more),
- Tenure (early-stage users churn more),
- Senior Citizens, Internet Services, and Value-Added Services.

### **📈 Visualizations:**

1. Countplots and Pie Charts for churn distribution
2. Stacked bar charts to show churn by senior citizens
3. Histograms of tenure and service usage
4. Countplots of service types with churn comparison
5. Payment method vs churn bar charts

---

### **💡 Recommendations:**

1. Promote long-term contracts (churn is just 3% on 2-year contracts)
2. Incentivize customers to avoid electronic checks
3. Focus retention efforts on early-tenure users
